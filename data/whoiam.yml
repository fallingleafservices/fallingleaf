title: Who I Am
content: >-
  My name is Scott Cereghino. Iâ€™ve been worked in the forestry and arborist
  business over the last 10 years. I began Falling Leaf Tree Care and associated
  Services with the hopes of bringing my experience from the forest landscapes,
  my love of Bonsai and combining my climbing skills into the the urban
  environment to create a unique blend of skills here in Central Oregon and in
  Bend.  My goal at Falling Leaf Tree Care is to help in any and all tree
  knowledge, perform specialty pruning, and provide stump grinding services to
  the smaller tree companies and the local landscapers.


  These days I find myself working more on the smaller backyard projects. I can always work with you on large scale projects which include a harvest plan, or creating a natural and fire defensible space across your landscape. No matter the size of the job, I always ensure the project focus is on what the desirable outcome will be.  


  Falling Leaf is a small family owned business where often the job is completed on a handshake. If your projects is larger and more complicated, we may need to discuss a written contract to ensure we are following the rules set by the State of Oregon. If you have any questions based upon contractor's requirements, feel free to ask, or go to the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ccb/pages/index" target="_blank">Oregon Contractors web page</a>.


  For reference, my Contractor's License number is: Falling Leaf Tree Care, LLC    CCB#235548
