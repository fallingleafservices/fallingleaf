project1Content: Home Construction Projects are always a giant step towards life
  long goals. We want your projects to be successful!! I have worked on large
  scale Forest Harvest projects, so a home project is definitely within my
  scope. As in all projects, details will need to be worked out so you receive
  the best and most accurate job for the project. Small projects are always
  welcome, such as falling trees to create sun for a garden, or removing the
  ugly stump in the front yard, I am here to help out.

project2Content: If youâ€™re looking for a licensed Tree Service to manage a large
  area of 5-15 acres (or more) around your home to create a pleasing atmosphere
  and create a fire defensible space. Feel free to reach out. I have worked on a
  number of large scale Forest Service Contracts with multiple complexities.
  Selective tree harvesting and pruning is perfect for these types of projects.
  The insight of knowing how to accomplish the project needs are important.  We
  are here to help you with your goals.
