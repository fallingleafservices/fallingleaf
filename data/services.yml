  Having a stump in the yard can be either a blessing or a distraction. Stumps
  in the environment can provide shelter and excellent nourishment for many of
  the animals who also live in our environment with us such as worms, beetles,
  bats, birds, salamanders and more. I have read a few articles which say a
  decaying tree or stump provides more wildlife habitat than does a living tree.
  I am not fully convinced, but it is definitely something to consider. But
  sometimes we just don't want a stump in our yard!! To remove those undesired
  stumps, grinding is often necessary to speed up the decomposition process.
  Grinding removes the stump surface down 2-3 inches below the soil surface
  where the stump can decompose quickly.


  When evaluating your stump for grinding, the cost will be $4 per inch across the widest part of the stump to where it makes contact with the soil. 


  If there is a request to go deeper than the normal 2-3 inches, we may be able to grind down an additional 2-3 inches at a $8 per inch. 


  Sometimes there are roots that run along the surface from the trunk. This extra grinding usually cost around $5 per foot.


  Lastly, trees can grow almost anywhere. There are trees growing out of cracks on cliffsides. If you have a stump in a rocks that you would like to have removed, this will need to be completed by hand with an old fashioned hammer, axe and splitting wedges. Since each stump within rocks is an unknown, these stump will be billed by the hour, at $75/hour, to remove.

  Pruning is a major part of an arborist work. Pruning helps maintain balance
  throughout a tree. There are many reason to have a tree pruned. The main
  reason most pruning is done is to create a strong and healthy structure in a
  tree. A strong structure builds resiliency from winds and snow, as well as
  also creating a more esthetically appealing tree.  


  Here in Central Oregon another major reason to prune is to create a fire resistant landscape. by limbing up low lying branches, this will remove ladder fuels that lift heat and flames higher in a trees canopy help prevent deadly crown fires. 


  Another reason to prune is to help remove long heavy limbs that can easily break under those snowloads or wind events. On occasion branches will reach way out to find accessible light. unfortunately this often happens over our homes (or our neighbors). These heavy branches do not always need to be removed entirely, just cut back to a place where the branches can be more balanced and able to regrow in a manner that has greater strength.


  Lastly, pruning is a key to provide better fruit production or flowering. Fruit trees need to be pruned at proper times of the year in accordance with what the output is required. Fruit needs lots of sunlight and proper air flow to create the best possible fruit you can grow.

  We all have so many different types of projects. from falling a tree in an
  open field to piecing down a tree next to your home, we can come give you free
  quote for a removal.  


  We make sure to discuss the details with you before beginning any project so you know exactly what to expect, and exactly how much itâ€™s going to cost. Tree felling is inherently dangerous and often makes a big mess. So by discussing the general plan with you is important. There is a lot of material in a tree and when it comes down it comes down hard. Then the clean up begins! Clean up is tedious and takes time. We will discuss what items in your yard should be removed to prevent damage, as well as what we can do to help in that regard. That is what we are here to help with. 


  Discussion of your plan for a tree pruning, tree removal, or stump grinding are what we do, and we are here to help you see it through!

  Bonsai happens to be a hobby I have taken to heart. To me Bonsai is the
  combination of my love of all things natural. That love includes trees, and
  the soil, rocks, wildlife and more.  


  My journey has led me to the hobby of growing, shaping, and designing small trees into unique and artful displays within small containers. This allows my artful side to combine with my nature side. Here at Falling Leaf, trimming and pruning trees is one of the main jobs. With bonsai, or our potted patio trees, the pruning needs to be more precise, and with full intention. Secondly Wiring can and will be applied to redirect growth in a more esthetical appeal. Lastly, trees grow!! and their roots fill up the pots and utilize the soil which was in the

   in we can help replant trees in any variety of pots, from small bonsai containers to your large 20 gal pots which need root pruning and fresh soil. 

  And as my family says, "I am bonkers for bonsai." Bonsai has become one of my favorite hobbies, esp during the spring and fall when they start to bloom, leaf out and show their vigor as they come out of winter dormancy.
