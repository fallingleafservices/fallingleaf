stumpGrindingContent: <p>Having a stump in the yard can be either a blessing or a distraction. Stumps in the environment can provide shelter and excellent nourishment for many of the animals who also live in our environment with us such as worms, beetles, bats, birds, salamanders and more. Yet to remove those undesired stumps, grinding is often necessary to speed up the decomposition process. Grinding removes the surface stump down 2-3 inches below the soil surface where the stump can decompose quickly.</p>

bonsaiContent: <p>Bonsai happens to be a hobby I have taken to heart. Bonsai is the combination of my love of all things natural, the trees, and the soil in which we walk upon.  My journey has led me to a the hobby of growing, shaping, and designing small trees in unique and artful containers. And as my family says, "I am bonkers for bonsai." Bonsai has become one of my favorite hobbies, esp during the spring and fall when they start to bloom, leaf out and show their vigor as they come out of winter dormancy.</p>
