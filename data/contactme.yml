content: If youâ€™re looking for an experienced Tree Service Contractor for
  your next project give me a ring!  I work at a local nursery in Bend to stay
  knowledgeable and up to date on the local trees, their health, and growth
  patterns throughout the year. Knowledge of the the many varieties of trees
  which grow here in Central Oregon help make informed decisions and knowledge
  when issues inevitably arise. I explain the steps in the process to ensure you
  have the service you need. If you are looking for a simple pruning job, we
  might just arrive with the tools and the gear and get started right away. It
  all depends on the project, what the days are looking like, and what your
  project needs. Call today for your free estimate.
