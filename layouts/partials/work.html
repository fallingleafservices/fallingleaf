				<p>Home Construction is always a giant step towards life long goals. I have worked on large scale Forest Harvest projects, so a home operation is definitely within my scope. As in all projects, details will need to be worked out so you receive the best and most accurate job for the project.
				Small projects are always welcome, such as falling trees in preparation of a pole barn or shed. I am here to help out.</p>
